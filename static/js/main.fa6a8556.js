It eliminates the need for a just-in-time (JIT) compiler in the browser, which can improve performance and reduce the size of the application. AOT compilation can also catch errors and improve the security of an application by detecting issues at build time instead of runtime. AOT compilation is enabled by default in Angular and can be further optimized using tools like Tree shaking and Lazy loading."},{id:"13",question:"What is lazy loading in Angular?",answer:"Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows modules or components to be loaded on-demand instead of upfront. It can improve the performance of an application by reducing the initial load time and loading only the necessary components when needed. Lazy loading is typically used for large or complex applications that have a lot of different views or components, or for applications that are deployed in environments with limited bandwidth or resources. Lazy loading can be implemented using the loadChildren method in the router configuration."},{id:"14",question:"What is the difference between ngIf and ngSwitch in Angular?",answer:"ngIf is a directive in Angular that conditionally adds or removes an element from the DOM based on a boolean expression. It is useful for showing or hiding elements based on a condition. ngSwitch, on the other hand, is a directive that conditionally adds or removes elements based on a switch statement. It is useful for displaying different content based on a set of conditions. ngSwitch can be more efficient than ngIf for complex conditions or multiple conditions, as it evaluates the condition only once and then displays the appropriate content based on the value of the switch statement."},{id:"15",question:"What is a service in Angular?",answer:"A service in Angular is a class that provides a specific functionality or feature to components in an application. Services are typically used to share data or functionality across multiple components, and can be injected into components using dependency injection.

Services can also be used to manage state in an application using observables or NgRx."},{id:"16",question:"What is dependency injection in Angular?",answer:"Dependency injection is a design pattern in Angular that allows components and services to be loosely coupled by providing dependencies through the constructor. Instead of creating or managing dependencies within a component or service, Angular injects the dependencies at runtime using a hierarchical injector. This allows for greater flexibility and maintainability of an application, as components and services can be easily tested and modified without affecting other parts of the application. Dependency injection is also useful for sharing common functionality across an application, such as logging or error handling."},{id:"17",question:"What is the difference between template-driven forms and reactive forms in Angular?",answer:"Template-driven forms and reactive forms are two approaches to building forms in Angular. Template-driven forms use two-way data binding to synchronize the form model and view, and rely on directives like ngModel to handle form input validation and submission. Template-driven forms are simpler to implement and are useful for smaller or simpler forms. Reactive forms, on the other hand, use a reactive programming style to build forms, and rely on observable streams to handle form input validation and submission. Reactive forms provide greater flexibility and control over form validation and data manipulation, and are useful for complex or dynamic forms."},{id:"18",question:"What is the difference between ViewChild and ContentChild in Angular?",answer:"ViewChild and ContentChild are two decorators in Angular that are used to access child components or elements within a parent component. ViewChild is used to access a child component or element that is declared in the parent component's template using the #reference syntax. ContentChild, on the other hand, is used to access a child component or element that is projected into the parent component using ng-content. ViewChild is useful for accessing child components or elements directly, while ContentChild is useful for accessing projected content that may be dynamic or conditional."},{id:"19",question:"What is NgZone in Angular?",answer:"NgZone is a service in Angular that provides a way to execute code outside or inside of the Angular zone, which is a mechanism for tracking asynchronous tasks and triggering change detection. NgZone is useful for managing performance and avoiding change detection issues caused by long-running or synchronous tasks. Code that is executed outside of the Angular zone, using NgZone.runOutsideAngular(), is not tracked by Angular's change detection, which can improve performance. Code that is executed inside the Angular zone, using NgZone.run(), is tracked by Angular's change detection, which can trigger updates to the view."},{id:"20",question:"What is a resolver in Angular?",answer:"A resolver in Angular is a service that is used to resolve data before a route is activated. Resolvers are useful for fetching data from a server or performing other asynchronous tasks that are required for a route to be displayed. Resolvers can be used to preload data for a component, or to prevent a component from being displayed until all of its required data has been fetched. Resolvers are typically implemented as a separate service, and are added to the route definition as a property of the route."},{id:"21",question:"What is the purpose of the ActivatedRoute service in Angular?",answer:"The ActivatedRoute service in Angular is used to retrieve information about the current route, including any parameters or query strings. ActivatedRoute is typically used in a component that is associated with a particular route, and is injected into the component using dependency injection. ActivatedRoute provides access to the current route's parameters, query strings, data, and any child routes, which can be used to update the component's view or state."},{id:"22",question:"What is the purpose of the router-outlet directive in Angular?",answer:"The router-outlet directive in Angular is used to display the content of a routed component.
