    question: "What is version control and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, allowing you to track and manage revisions. It is important because it enables collaboration, prevents data loss, allows for reverting to previous versions, and helps in tracking project history and bug tracking.",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    question:
      "What are the differences between centralized and distributed version control systems?",
    answer:
      "Centralized version control systems (CVCS) have a single, central repository where all changes are stored. Distributed version control systems (DVCS) have multiple repositories, allowing each developer to have a full copy of the project history. DVCS offers better performance, scalability, and enables offline work, while CVCS has simpler access control and a more linear history.",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "What is Git and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. It works by taking snapshots of the project files, tracking changes, and storing them in a local repository. Developers can commit changes, create branches, and merge branches with ease.",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "What is a Git commit and what information does it store?",
    answer:
      "A Git commit is a snapshot of the project files at a specific point in time. It stores information about the changes made, the author, the date and time, and a unique identifier (hash) that references the commit. It also includes a commit message describing the changes made in that commit.",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "What are branches in Git and why are they useful?",
    answer:
      "Branches in Git are pointers to a specific commit, allowing developers to work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. They are useful because they enable parallel development, make it easy to merge changes, and allow for better organization and management of the project history.",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "How do you create and switch between branches in Git?",
    answer:
      'To create a new branch, use the command "git branch [branch_name]". To switch between branches, use the command "git checkout [branch_name]". Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in one command using "git checkout -b [branch_name]".',
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "What is a merge conflict in Git and how can it be resolved?",
    answer:
      "A merge conflict occurs when two branches have made changes to the same line in a file or when a file has been deleted in one branch but modified in the other. To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicting file, choose the desired changes, and then stage and commit the resolved file.",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "What is a remote repository in Git and how do you add one?",
    answer:
      "A remote repository in Git is a version of your project hosted on a remote server, allowing collaboration with other developers. To add a remote repository, use the command git remote add [remote_name] [remote_URL], where remote_name is a short alias for the remote repository and remote_URL is the repository's URL.",
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    question: 'What is the difference between "git fetch" and "git pull"?',
    answer:
      "git fetch downloads changes from a remote repository to your local repository, without automatically merging or updating your working copy. git pull, on the other hand, downloads changes and automatically merges them with your current branch, updating your working copy. Use git fetch when you want to review changes before merging, and git pull when you want to update your working copy with the latest changes from the remote repository.",
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    question: "What is a pull request and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "A pull request is a process of requesting that changes made in one branch be merged into another branch in a remote repository. It is important because it enables code review, collaboration, and ensures that changes are properly tested and reviewed before being integrated into the main codebase.",
  },
  {
    id: "11",
    question: "What is a Git rebase and when would you use it?",
    answer:
      "Git rebase is a process of rewriting the commit history by integrating changes from one branch onto another. It is used to maintain a linear project history, simplify complex commit histories, or update a feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch without creating a merge commit.",
  },
  {
    id: "12",
    question: 'What is the difference between "git stash" and "git branch"?',
    answer:
      "git stash temporarily saves changes in the working directory that are not yet committed, allowing you to switch to another branch or task without losing the changes. git branch is used to create, list, or delete branches in your repository, allowing parallel development and organization of your project.",
  },
  {
    id: "13",
    question: "What is a Git tag and when should you use it?",
    answer:
      "A Git tag is a reference to a specific commit, often used to mark release points or significant milestones in the project. You should use tags to create a permanent, easily identifiable reference to a specific commit, making it easy to track and manage different versions of your project.",
  },
  {
    id: "14",
    question: "How do you revert a commit in Git?",
    answer:
      'To revert a commit in Git, use the command "git revert [commit_hash]", where "commit_hash" is the unique identifier of the commit you want to revert. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit.',
  },
  {
    id: "15",
    question: "What is a .gitignore file and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "A .gitignore file is a configuration file that specifies which files or directories should be ignored by Git, meaning they will not be tracked, committed, or included in the repository. It is important because it helps keep the repository clean, prevents sensitive information from being committed, and reduces repository size by excluding unnecessary files.",
  },
  {
    id: "16",
    question: "What is SVN and how does it differ from Git?",
    answer:
      "SVN (Subversion) is a centralized version control system. It differs from Git in that it uses a single central repository, has a simpler, linear commit history, and relies on a client-server architecture. Git is a distributed version control system, which allows for offline work, multiple repositories, and has better performance and scalability.",
  },
  {
    id: "17",
    question: 'What is a "fork" in the context of version control?',
    answer:
      "A fork is a process of creating a copy of an existing repository, usually hosted on a remote server, allowing you to make changes and experiment without affecting the original project. Forks are commonly used in open-source projects to contribute code, fix bugs, or add features, and can be merged back into the original repository through pull requests.",
  },
  {
    id: "18",
    question: 'What is "git stash" and when would you use it?',
    answer:
      "git stash is a command that temporarily saves changes in your working directory that are not yet committed, allowing you to switch to a different branch or task without losing your progress. You would use git stash when you need to pause your current work, switch to a different branch for a quick fix or review, and then return to your original task without losing your uncommitted changes.",
  },
  {
    id: "19",
    question: 'What is "cherry-picking" in Git and when would you use it?',
    answer:
      "Cherry-picking in Git is a process of selectively applying changes from specific commits in one branch to another branch. It is useful when you want to include a particular bug fix or feature from one branch without merging the entire branch, or when you need to apply a specific change to multiple branches.",
  },
  {
    id: "20",
    question: 'What is the purpose of the "git blame" command?',
    answer:
      'The "git blame" command is used to display the commit history of each line in a file, showing the author, commit hash, and date when the change was made. This helps in identifying who made specific changes, understanding the context of changes, and tracking down the source of bugs or issues in the codebase.',
  },
  {
    id: "21",
    question: "How do you resolve a binary file conflict in Git?",
    answer:
      "To resolve a binary file conflict in Git, you must manually choose the correct version of the file from either the current branch or the branch being merged. Once you have selected the desired version, stage and commit the file to resolve the conflict.",
  },
  {
    id: "22",
    question: 'What is "git bisect" and how can it help in debugging?',
    answer:
      'git bisect is a command that helps in finding the commit that introduced a bug or issue by performing a binary search through the commit history. By marking commits as "good" or "bad," git bisect narrows down the range of commits to find the first "bad" commit, making it easier to identify the source of the issue and debug the problem.',
  },
  {
    id: "23",
    question: "What are submodules in Git and when would you use them?",
    answer:
      "Submodules in Git are a way to include external repositories within your project as a subdirectory. They allow you to keep separate version control for each submodule, making it easier to manage dependencies, share common code across multiple projects, or include third-party libraries. You would use submodules when you need to incorporate external code or separate parts of a large project into smaller, more manageable repositories.",
  },
  {
    id: "24",
    question: 'What is a "shallow clone" in Git and when would you use it?',
    answer:
      "A shallow clone in Git is a partial clone of a repository, where only the most recent commit history is retrieved, reducing the amount of data transferred and the time it takes to clone. You would use a shallow clone when you want to save bandwidth, storage space, or time, or when you only need the latest version of a project and not its entire history.",
