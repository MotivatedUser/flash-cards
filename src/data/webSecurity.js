    question: "What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and how can you prevent it?",
    answer:
      "XSS is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Prevention includes encoding user-generated content, validating input, using Content Security Policy (CSP), and using secure libraries for rendering user content.",

  {
    id: "9",
    question:
      "What is the difference between authentication and authorization?",
    answer:
      "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on their identity or role.",
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    question: "What is HTTPS, and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data transmitted between a client and a server using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It is important for protecting sensitive data, ensuring data integrity, and building user trust.",

  {
    id: "11",
    question:
      "What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "CORS is a security feature that allows web applications to request resources from a different origin. It enables secure cross-origin data sharing while maintaining the Same-Origin Policy to protect users from malicious websites. CORS is important for modern web applications that rely on APIs hosted on different domains or subdomains.",
  },
  {
    id: "12",
    question: "What are secure cookies, and when should they be used?",
    answer:
      "Secure cookies are cookies transmitted only over HTTPS connections, preventing interception and tampering by malicious actors. They should be used when storing sensitive information, like session identifiers or authentication tokens, to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the application.",
  },
  {
    id: "13",
    question:
      "What is the principle of least privilege, and why is it important for web security?",
    answer:
      "The principle of least privilege states that users and applications should have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the potential impact of security breaches and limits the attack surface by minimizing the access attackers can gain through compromised accounts or vulnerabilities.",
  },
  {
    id: "14",
    question:
      "What are some best practices for securely transmitting data between the client and the server?",
    answer:
      "Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, implement secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth or JWT, use secure cookie settings (Secure and HttpOnly flags), and validate and sanitize all user input to protect against injection attacks.",
  },
  {
    id: "15",
    question:
      "What is a web application firewall (WAF), and how does it help with web security?",
    answer:
      "A WAF is a security solution that monitors and filters incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic to a web application. It protects against common web-based attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF by analyzing requests, blocking malicious traffic, and providing customizable security rules.",
  },
  {
    id: "16",
    question:
      "What is a security vulnerability disclosure policy, and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "A security vulnerability disclosure policy is a document that provides guidelines for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities found in a web application. It is important because it encourages responsible disclosure, fosters cooperation between developers and security researchers, and helps maintain the security and integrity of the application.",
  },
  {
    id: "17",
    question:
      "What are the OWASP Top Ten security risks, and why are they important?",
    answer:

  {
    id: "18",
    question:
      "What is subresource integrity (SRI), and how does it help with web security?",
    answer:
      "SRI is a security feature that allows browsers to verify the integrity of external resources, like scripts or stylesheets, by comparing their content against a cryptographic hash provided by the website. It helps prevent attacks like supply chain compromises and malicious tampering of third-party resources.",
  },
  {
    id: "19",
    question:
      "What is the difference between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) in terms of security?",
    answer:
      "In SSR, HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client, reducing the attack surface for XSS attacks. In CSR, HTML is generated on the client, making it more vulnerable to XSS attacks. However, both approaches have their security risks and require proper input validation, output encoding, and other security best practices.",
  },
  {
    id: "20",
    question:
      "What is a security header, and how can it help improve web security?",
    answer:
      "Security headers are HTTP response headers that provide additional security measures for web applications.

    question:
      "What is a brute force attack, and how can you protect against it?",
    answer:
      "A brute force attack is an attempt to gain access to a system by systematically trying all possible combinations of credentials until the correct one is found. Protection includes using strong passwords, implementing account lockout policies, CAPTCHAs, rate limiting, and two-factor authentication.",
  },

    question:
      "What is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and how can you prevent it?",
    answer:
      "A MITM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, allowing them to read, modify, or inject new data. Prevention includes using HTTPS, implementing certificate pinning, using secure Wi-Fi connections, and employing encrypted communication protocols like TLS.",
  },
  {
    id: "23",
    question:
      "What is input validation, and why is it important for web security?",
    answer:
      "Input validation is the process of ensuring that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and values. It is important for web security because it helps prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection by filtering out potentially harmful input and reducing the attack surface.",
  },
  {
    id: "24",
    question:
      "What are some key security considerations when working with third-party libraries or APIs?",
    answer:
      "Considerations include assessing the security reputation of the library or API, keeping them up-to-date, using secure connections (HTTPS), verifying the integrity of external resources (e.g., with Subresource Integrity), and implementing proper error handling and input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.",
