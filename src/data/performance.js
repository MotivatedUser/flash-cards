    question: 'What are some common techniques to optimize web performance?',
    answer: 'Common techniques include: minifying and compressing files, optimizing images, using a CDN, caching, lazy loading, code splitting, and reducing HTTP requests.'
    },
    {
    id: '2',
    question: 'How does browser caching improve web performance?',
    answer: 'Browser caching stores files on the client side, reducing server requests and latency, thus speeding up page load times for subsequent visits to the same site.'
    },
    {
    id: '3',
    question: 'What is the critical rendering path and why is it important?',
    answer: 'The critical rendering path is the sequence of steps taken by the browser to render the initial view of a page. Optimizing it minimizes load time and improves user experience.'
    },
    {
    id: '4',
    question: 'What is lazy loading and how does it improve web performance?',
    answer: 'Lazy loading defers the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed, reducing initial load time and saving bandwidth for both the server and client.'
    },
    {
    id: '5',
    question: 'What are some best practices for optimizing image performance?',
    answer: 'Best practices include: using proper formats, compressing images, using responsive images, implementing lazy loading, and using CSS sprites for icons.'
    },
    {
    id: '6',
    question: 'What is code splitting and how does it improve web performance?',
    answer: 'Code splitting is the process of dividing a single large bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, reducing initial load time and improving user experience.'
    },
    {
    id: '7',
    question: 'How can you use HTTP/2 to improve web performance?',
    answer: 'HTTP/2 provides features like multiplexing, header compression, and server push, which reduce latency, speed up content delivery, and improve overall performance.'
    },
    {
    id: '8',
    question: 'What is the role of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in web performance?',
    answer: 'A CDN is a network of servers that caches and delivers content from the server closest to the user, reducing latency, improving load times, and minimizing server load.'
    },
    {
    id: '9',
    question: 'What are some performance metrics to consider when evaluating web performance?',
    answer: 'Key metrics include: Time to First Byte (TTFB), First Contentful Paint (FCP), First Meaningful Paint (FMP), Time to Interactive (TTI), and Speed Index (SI).'
    },
    {
    id: '10',
    question: 'How can you monitor web performance and identify potential bottlenecks?',
    answer: 'Use browser dev tools, profiling tools, and performance monitoring services to analyze performance, identify bottlenecks, and gather insights for optimization.'
    },
