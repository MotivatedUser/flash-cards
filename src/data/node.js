    {
    id: '7',
    question: 'What is the difference between the "exports" and "module.exports" in Node.js?',
    answer: '"exports" is an object that is used to expose functions or variables from a module. "module.exports" is the actual object that gets exported. Assigning a new value to "exports" breaks the reference to "module.exports".'

      {
        id: '12',
        question: 'What is middleware in the context of Node.js?',
        answer: 'Middleware is a function that sits between the server and the client and intercepts requests and responses. It is used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling, and can modify the request or response objects as needed.'
      },
      {
        id: '13',
        question: 'What are the differences between PUT and POST requests in Node.js?',
        answer: 'PUT requests are used for updating existing resources, while POST requests are used for creating new resources. PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that sending the same request multiple times has the same effect as sending it once. POST requests are not idempotent.'
      },
      {
        id: '14',
        question: 'What is JWT and how is it used in Node.js?',
        answer: 'JWT (JSON Web Token) is a standard for creating access tokens that can be used for authentication and authorization. JWTs are used to securely transmit information between parties, such as a client and server, and can be verified using a secret key or public key cryptography.'
